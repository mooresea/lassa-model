Estimate sub-national LASV infections and LF incidence rates in West Africa

This repository contains the code to recreate the modeling analysis in the article "Estimation of Lassa fever incidence rates in West Africa: development of a modeling framework to inform vaccine trial design". This article is currently available as a preprint at: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.11.24318478 

The analysis involves running the following R scripts from the 'code' directory:

0. prior_iceberg.R
1. step1_analyze_sero_lassa.R
